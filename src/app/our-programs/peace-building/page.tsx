             The foundation focuses on initiatives such as roundtable discussions, training sessions, and capacity-building efforts.
              It actively engages with the community, particularly youth and women, through education and empowerment programs. 
            A key achievement includes providing financial literacy training, resulting in 40 graduates, both locals and non-locals, under Ujamaaâ€™s guidance."
